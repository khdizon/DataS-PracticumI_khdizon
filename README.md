# Ramp Metering Colorado I-25
### MSDS692 Data Science Practicum Regis University
### USER: Ken Dizon

I-25 is an interstate highway with high demand connecting the North and South of Colorado. During rush hour the highway is subject to pre-timed metering to enable the frequency of vehicles at specific locations (ramps) to enter the freeway. 
New devices known at TIRTLs monitor lane level data and are located on Northbound I-25 between Ridgegate Parkway and University Boulevard. The total of 18 ramps along this corridor collect features such as but not limited to; speed, lane, vehicle class, spacing, and heading. Ability to see real-time traffic conditions enable opportunities for a ramp metering system to adjust traffic patterns to enhance the quality of life such as the reduction in time, collision, and emissions. 
Using the data I wish to discover traffic responsive methods to better control traffic flow onto the highway.
