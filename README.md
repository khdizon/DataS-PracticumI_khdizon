# Ramp Metering Colorado I-25
### MSDS692 Data Science Practicum Regis University
### USER: Ken Dizon

I-25 is an interstate highway with high demand connecting the North and South of Colorado. During rush hour the highway is subject to pre-timed metering to enable the frequency of vehicles at specific locations (ramps) to enter the freeway. New devices known at TIRTLs monitor lane level data and are located on Northbound I-25 between Ridgegate Parkway and University Boulevard. The total of 18 ramps along this corridor collect features such as but not limited to; speed, lane, vehicle class, spacing, and heading. Ability to see real-time traffic conditions enable opportunities for a ramp metering system to adjust traffic patterns to enhance the quality of life such as the reduction in time, collision, and emissions. Using the data I wish to discover traffic responsive methods to better control traffic flow onto the highway.

### Task: classification using supervised learning

Highway data in conjunction with ramp metering initiatives aids elements of traffic speed, time reduction, collision reduction, and emission reduction calculations. The data science task involved in my project will follow the CRISPR-DM process. Incorporating the task of data understanding and preparation with aid my specific machine learning model. Traffic responsive ramp metering requires a regression model to predict traffic quantity and classification to determine traffic phases. As my model is chosen the key component of work follows cleansing, testing the machine learning using statistical modeling to compare and evaluate my machine learning models.
